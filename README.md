### partis

Partis is an HMM-based framework for B- and T-cell receptor sequence annotation, simulation, clonal family and germline inference, and affinity prediction.
It is built on top of the [ham](https://github.com/psathyrella/ham) HMM compiler and [ig-sw](https://github.com/matsengrp/ig-sw) set of Smith-Waterman annotation tools.
Partis is free software under the GPL v3.

The various components are described in the following papers.
Since they do quite different things, it's best if you can cite the specific paper(s) that describe the components that you're using.

The manual is divided into the following pages:

  * [Installation](docs/install.md)
  * [Quick start](docs/quick-start.md)
  * [Subcommands](docs/subcommands.md)
  * [Output formats](docs/output-formats.md)
  * [Plotting](docs/plotting.md)
  * [Germline inference confidence](docs/germline-inference.md)
  * [Parallelization](docs/parallel.md)

Details on the many options not documented here may be found by running each subcommand's help, for instance `partis cache-parameters --help` or `partis simulate --help`.
