## IgDiscover configuration

library_name: testdata


# How many discovery iterations to run.
# If 0, no updated database is created, but expression
# profiles are still computed.
iterations: 2


## Barcoding settings


# If you have a random barcode sequence (unique molecular identifier) at the 5' end,
# set this to its length. Leave at 0 when you have no 5' barcode.
barcode_length_5prime: 0


# Same as above, but for the 3' end of the sequence. Leave at 0 when you have no 3' barcode.
# Currently, you cannot have a barcode in both ends, so at least one of the two settings
# must be zero.
barcode_length_3prime: 0


# When barcoding is enabled, sequences are automatically grouped by barcode
# and by their CDR3 sequence. The CDR3 location is either detected with a
# regular expressions or a 'pseudo' CDR3 sequence is used, which is at a
# pre-defined position within the sequence. Seting this configuration option to
# [-80, -60] (which is the default) means that a pseudo CDR3 is to be used,
# located at bases 80 to 60 counted from the 3' end. (Use negative numbers to
# count from the 3' end, positive ones to count from the 5' end. The most 5'
# base has index 0.)
#
# Set this to 'detect' (with quotation marks) in order to use CDR3s
# detected by regular expression.
#
# Set this to false (no quotation marks) in order to *only* group by barcode, not by CDR3.
cdr3_location: [-80, -60]


# When you use a RACE protocol, then the sequences have a run of G nucleotides in the beginning
# which need to be removed when barcodes are used. If you use RACE, set this to true.
# The G nucleotides are assumed to be in the 5' end (but after the barcode if it exists).
#
race_g: false


## Primer-related settings

# If set to true, it is assumed that the forward primer is always at the 5' end
# of the first read and that the reverse primer is always at the 5' end of the
# second read. If it can also be the other way, set this to false.
# This setting has no effect if no primer sequences are defined below.
# stranded: true


# List of 5' primers
# forward_primers:
#  - CGTGAGCTGAGTACGACTCACTATAGCTTCAC


# List of 3' primers
# reverse_primers:
 # - GCAGGCCTTTTTGGCCNNNNNGGGGCATTCTCACAGGAGACGAGGGGGAAAAG  # IgM


# Work only on this number of reads (for quick test runs). Set to false to
# process all reads.
#
#limit: false


##
## Advanced settings (usually these do not need to be changed)
##

# Filter out merged reads that are shorter than this length.
minimum_merged_read_length: 300


# When discovering new V genes, ignore whether a J gene has been assigned
# and also ignore its %SHM.
#  true: yes, ignore the J
#  false: do not ignore J assignment, do not ignore its %SHM
#
ignore_j: false


# Read merging program. Choose either 'pear' or 'flash'.
# pear merges more reads, but is slower.
#
#merge_program: pear


# Which program to use for computing multiple alignments. This is used for
# computing consens sequences.
# Choose 'mafft', 'clustalo', 'muscle' or 'muscle-fast'.
# 'muscle-fast' runs muscle with parameters "-maxiters 1 -diags".
#
#multialign_program: muscle-fast


# Maximum overlap (-M) for the flash read merger.
# If you use pear, this is ignored.
#
flash_maximum_overlap: 300


# When clustering sequences to discover new genes, subsample to this number of
# sequences. Higher is slower.
#
subsample: 1000


# Which program to use for clustering. Use vsearch or usearch (can also be an
# absolute path).
#
#cluster_program: vsearch


# Filter out reads that have more than this number of expected errors.
# Set to null to disable.
#
#maximum_expected_errors: null
#maximum_expected_errors: 5


# Do not mention the original FASTA or FASTQ sequence names in the
# assigned.tab files, but instead use names <library_name>_seq<number>,
# where <number> is a running number starting at 1.
#  true: yes, rename
#  false: no, do not rename
#
rename: true


# Whether debugging is enabled or not. Currently, if this is set to true,
# some large intermediate files that would otherwise be deleted will be
# kept.
#
debug: false


# The "seed value" is in arbitrary number used to get reproducible
# runs. Two runs that use the same software version, the same seed
# and otherwise the same configuration will give identical results.
#
# Set this to false in order to use a different seed each run.
# The results will then be not exactly reproducible.
#
seed: 1


# Leave empty or choose a species name supported by IgBLAST:
# human, mouse, rabbit, rat, rhesus_monkey
# This setting is not used anywhere except that it is passed
# to IgBLAST. Since we provide IgBLAST with our own gene
# databases, it seems this has no effect.
